## Spring Framework

Prior to the advent of Enterprise Java Beans(EJB), Java developers needed to use JavaBeans to create Web Application. Although Java Beans could develop the UI components, they were not able to provide services such as Transaction management and Security. EJB became the Solution. However the Development using EJB was difficult so Spring Framework emerged.

Spring Uses various new Techniques such as:

1. Aspect Oriented Programming
2. Plain Old Java Object
3. Dependency Injection

Spring is an Open-Source lightweight framework used to build Simple, Reliable, and Scalable Enterprise.

Spring Framework can be considered as a Collection of Sub-Frameworks also called Layers, such as 

1. Spring AOP
2. Spring ORM
3. Spring Web Flow
4. Spring Web MVC

Ways To Implemene

1. By XML
2. By Programming Approach
3. Using Annotations

## Bean Life Cycle

Bean Lifecycle refer to how it is Born, How it Behaves and When & How it Dies. Managed by Spring Containers. When we run the Program first the Spring Container is Started, after that the container creates the Instance of the Bean as per the Request, and then the Dependencies are injected. And Finally the Bean is Destroyed when the Container is Closed. If we want to Execute a code just after the Creation then we can use int() and if we want to Execute a Code just before destruction the we can write it in destroy().

## Java Anotations

There are used to provide extra information about a prgram and provide metadata to class/method.

1. @Override : Helps validate overriding of methods as a warning will be flashed incase we make an error while defining the Overridden method.

2. @SuppressWarning : Used to suppress warnings generated by the Compiler. eg. @SuppressWarning("deprecated")

3. @Deprecated : Used to mark a Deprecated Function, it will throw a Deprecation warning during Runtime.

4. @Function Interface : Used to mark a Functional Interface. A warning will be flashed.

*A function interface is an interface that contains only a single abstract(un-implemented) method. A functional interface contains default and static methods which donot have implementation in addition to a single unimplemented method.*

5. @PostConstruct : Used on a method that needs to be **executed after dependency injection** is done to perform any initialization.

Spring calls methods annotated with @PostConstruct only once, just after the initialization of bean properties. Will run even if no initialization.

Can have any access level but cannot be static.

Eg. Use to populate a Database.

6. @PreDestroy : Runs only once, just before Spring removes our Bean from the Application Context. Can have any access level but cannot be static. To release Resources and Cleanup task.
